# SkyBlue

SkyBlue is a tool with one primary goal - **To promote the usage of web color names**.

In SkyBlue you can find, and easily get around, with all the 140 web colors we know. You can see them all, in one big group, or you can view them by theirs category, like red, brown, purple, and so on. By hovering the mouse over the color, you get the name. And when you click on it, you get red, green, and blue values.

By seeing the color's name, and by having the ability to look under the hood, for RGB values, you get a great teaching tool as well. It helps you to get a better visual, and better understaning of how the colors are made.

The lines under are equivalent. As you can see, using the color name is cool and self-explanatory.

```css
.text {

  color: Orange;
  color: rgb(255, 165, 0);

  color: DarkOrange;
  color: rgb(255, 140, 0);

  color: SkyBlue;
  color: rgb(135, 206, 235);

}
```

Start using the color names now! Thank you! :-)
